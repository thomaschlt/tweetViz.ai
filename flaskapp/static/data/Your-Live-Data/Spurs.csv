2,0,I remember Spurs getting relegated and lived through the 90s tediousness but this season may well rank as the worst.

8,0,Few of us including you have been saying for ages that the players we’ve got aren’t capable of playing in a 4. Same with the starting 3 mids. They are all too similar. Doesn’t work. Conte was restricted to that formation.,Spurs,twitter user,0,0.79717237,0.18619958,0.016628074
