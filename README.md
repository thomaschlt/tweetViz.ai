A Flask application featuring a data visualization tool for real-time analysis of Twitter trends data, including sentiment analysis. To do so, i used a roBERTa-base model trained on ~58M tweets and finetuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark. You can find the ðŸ¤— page of the model [here](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment).
The tool also showcases a dynamic web component utilizing a [force-directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) iterative layout to represent each trend within a 3-dimensional graph structure (D3.js) !
